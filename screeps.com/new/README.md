# SuperColin Screeps Scripts!! :D

Autospawn module respawns creeps according to roles set in main & main.config

To add a new role copy and edit the bodyParts, behavior & main and import them in main & main.config

Tasks are added to the Creep prototype to be able to use calls like creep.task(opts)

If new memory attributes for Creeps are required then they can be added to new spawns in spawn.spawn in the memory object

"l_" stands for "last_"

"Profiles" of execution, adjust CPU usage ....
"Profiles" of goals, more defensive less ....
